# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
For my topic, I would like to talk about zoos, how ethical they are, and the conservational work they achieve. I have always loved zoos. They are some of my favorite places to visit. I love getting to see and learn about new species. I also find zoo design fascinating, such as how a zoo decides to showcase its animals, how they choose where their species are located relative to one another (some appear random, some have themes), and how each zoo takes a different stance on educating people about climate change and other human impacts on the natural world.

I also know that zoos have seen their fair share of controversies. Perhaps the biggest is the discussion around putting these animals on display. _Are these animals in zoos for their benefit or for our benefit?_ As someone who personally loves zoos, this question has always stuck around with me. At what point are zoos not helping their animals and are just profiting from them for entertainment? In this data story, I want to dive into the pros and cons of modern zoos. I want to talk about these animals being constrained in zoos, but also the conservation work that is achieved in zoos.

It is at this point that I have to admit my bias. Not only do I love zoos as a guest, but I was also a zookeeper for the Oglebay Good Zoo. I'm attaching one of my photos from this job, this is Hamlet the Red Panda.

I believe that this is an important aspect of my story because I have some inside information on how zoos work as a staff member. I will talk a lot about the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) in this story, which is the main symbol of quality for zoos. The AZA forces members to follow strict guidelines to ensure animal happiness above all else, failure to comply with these guidelines will result in the zoo getting kicked out of the organization. The Oglebay Good Zoo is privileged to be the only zoo in West Virginia to have AZA status, which we took with great pride. Being an AZA zoo means that we have access to a breeding network to ensure genetic quality in our animals to return them to their natural environment hopefully. At Oglebay, we had two breeding pairs of Carolina Red Wolves, which are a critically endangered species. We took special care to ensure that these animals would be re-wilded, we didn't even give them names and the wolves couldn't see us filling their food containers so that they wouldn't trust people to feed them. All of this is to say AZA zoos take great care for conservation and ensuring animal happiness. Yet there is still a lot of improvement that can be made. I do believe animals could have larger enclosures, and it can be immoral to keep very intelligent species, such as elephants, cetaceans, and Great Apes, in captivity. I'm hoping to strike a balance between what zoos are doing well and what can be improved in this presentation.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 



## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
