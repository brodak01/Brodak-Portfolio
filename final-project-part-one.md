# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
For my topic, I would like to talk about zoos, how ethical they are, and the conservational work they achieve. I have always loved zoos. They are some of my favorite places to visit. I love getting to see and learn about new species. I also find zoo design fascinating, such as how a zoo decides to showcase its animals, how they choose where their species are located relative to one another (some appear random, some have themes), and how each zoo takes a different stance on educating people about climate change and other human impacts on the natural world.

I also know that zoos have seen their fair share of controversies. Perhaps the biggest is the discussion around putting these animals on display. _Are these animals in zoos for their benefit or for our benefit?_ As someone who personally loves zoos, this question has always stuck around with me. At what point are zoos not helping their animals and are just profiting from them for entertainment? In this data story, I want to dive into the pros and cons of modern zoos. I want to talk about these animals being constrained in zoos, but also the conservation work that is achieved in zoos.

It is at this point that I have to admit my bias. I was a zookeeper for the Oglebay Good Zoo.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.
